# Pong-Game

The Pong Game is a classic two-player game where each player controls a paddle and tries to hit a ball back and forth between them. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle. This project is an implementation of the Pong Game using Python and Turtle graphics library.

The game consists of a rectangular playing field with two paddles on opposite sides of the screen and a ball in the center. The paddles can be moved up and down to hit the ball. The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls of the playing field and off the paddles. If the ball hits the left or right wall, the opposing player scores a point.

The project uses object-oriented programming principles to define classes for the player, ball, and map. It also implements keyboard listener events to detect when the players press the keys to move their paddles.

The game keeps track of the score for each player and displays it on the screen. The score is updated whenever a player scores a point.
